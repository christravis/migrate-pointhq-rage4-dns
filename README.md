Migrate DNS Records from PointHQ to Rage4
=========================

[PointHQ](https://pointhq.com) have started charging for their DNS service. This script uses their [REST API](https://pointhq.com/api/docs) to export all the domains and DNS records under your account and imports them into a free DNS service (upto 250k requests per month per domain) run by [Rage4](https://secure.rage4.com) using their [REST API](http://gbshouse.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/109834-rage4-dns-developers-api).
